In Python, functions are the first class objects, which means that â€“

Functions are objects; they can be referenced to, passed to a variable and
returned from other functions as well.

Functions can be defined inside another function and can also be passed 
as argument to another function.


# Syntax for decorator

@gfg_decorator
def hello_decorator():
    print("GFG")


Above code is equivalent to

def hello_decorator():
    print("GFG")

hello_decorator = gfg_decorator(hello_decorator)'''


# Decorator can modify the behaviour

    # inner function can access the outer local functions like in this
    # case func
