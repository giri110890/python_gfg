# Lists need not be homogeneous always which makes it a most powerful tool
# in Python. A single list may contain DataTypes like Integers, Strings,
# as well as Objects. Lists are mutable, and hence, they can be altered
# even after their creation.

# Note â€“ Unlike Sets, list may contain mutable elements.
